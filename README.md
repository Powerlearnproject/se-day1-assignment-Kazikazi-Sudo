Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

    Software engineering deals with the approaches to the design, develop, test, and maintain software systems. Software 
    engineering is important because it helps to create different things such as video games, mobile apps, robots, and  
    Solving real-world coding problems

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

    Software Development Life Cycle has the following cycles:- 
    - planning - involves analyzing and establishing a timeline for the project
    - design - this step involves outlining software product
    - coding/development - the step involves coding of the software 
    - testing - Involves testing the functionality of the developed software 
    - deployment - deploying the developed system to the operating environment
    - maintenance of the systems - managing the system to keep it working flawlessly


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

     Waterfall is stricter, and a more linear methodology that limits a team's ability to diverge from the project plan 
     during Software Development Life Cycle while on the other hand Agile is more flexible, giving teams a margin of 
     flexibility and enabling them to change the course during Software Development Life Cycle.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

   Software Developer main responsibility is to design and develop software/system
   A Quality Assurance Engineer monitors and tests software to try and identify issues 
   Project Manager role is to oversee the whole process of software creation


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are important tools in software development that help to increase productivity 
   and efficiency while on the hand Version Control Systems (VCS) helps developers move faster and more efficiently as 
   developers can always solve rising issues before progressing further.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    Inadequate resources - get fundings and facilitations
    The ever changing technological changes. They can overcome the challenge by keeping one updated on new languages
    Communication challenges - There is need to establish clear means of communications and platform to ensure people get information
    Poor Coordination - All members should put efforts to play their roles and coordinate
    

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
    unit testing involves carrying out tests to individual units of the system
    integration testing involves combining all units within a program and tests them as a group to identify functionality
    system testing involves testing the final software product with everything in place
    acceptance testing is carried out to identify whether the final software can be deployed for operation


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
    Prompt engineering involves giving instructions to AI and it is important as it hleps AI to do exactly what you need


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

   A vague prompt - Help me to create an image of a boy

   Improvememnt - Help me to create an image of a young energetic male, aged between 20-30, the skin tone should be dark, the clothing should be a black suit with a white shirt and a red tie, the background should be creame white


   Improving my prompt helps the AI to understand my needs and provide a more in-depth and focused response.
